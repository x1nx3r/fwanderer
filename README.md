1.  git clone this into C:/xampp/htdocs/ (or wherever your xampp/htdocs/ are located)
2.  create a user and a database on your mysql xampp from phpmyadmin (or any database tool to interact with mysql)
3.  create a "credentials.env" file that contains the user and database details to your mysql db
4.  access it on localhost/fwanderer/index.html
